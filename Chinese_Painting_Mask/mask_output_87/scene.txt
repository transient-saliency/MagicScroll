The stone creek old Taoist lives in seclusion, residing between deep ravines
 Flowing streams pass through white stones, and the cloudy cave enters the deep mountains
 The house's wind is delicate, and the monk's room is silent and cold
 Ling sand moistens the heart and lungs, growing old in a mountain cavern
