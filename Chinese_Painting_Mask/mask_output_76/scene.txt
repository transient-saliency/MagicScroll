Watching the mountains with concern, I step into rugged peaks
 Watching the water, I enjoy the sounds of flowing streams
 Mountain and water sentiment is like an unfinished painting, and the unfinished painting is like endless clouds
 Yuan Ji's interaction is a complete imitation
 The wonderful realm is elusive, and I think of climbing
 Indeed, there is a child, Mi Haiguo, but how can he compare to Gaofang Mountain
