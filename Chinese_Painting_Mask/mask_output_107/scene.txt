I recognize the ancient master of the square pot, now passing forty years
 In my chest, the primordial qi is mixed, streaming out like clouds and sparks
 The sparks ignite the secrets of creation, a name known throughout the Xiang River
 The one who held such thoughts has already transformed, but his ink still remains
