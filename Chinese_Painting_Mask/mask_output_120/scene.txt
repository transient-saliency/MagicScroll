Walking amidst the forests shrouded in clouds,Looking down to see the babbling brooks abound,Lifting my gaze to the endless mountains all around
Clouds, without a care, emerge from mountain hide,Birds,weary in flight, know when to return with the tide
Shadows lengthen, signaling day's imminent slide,Caressing a solitary pine, where my thoughts reside
