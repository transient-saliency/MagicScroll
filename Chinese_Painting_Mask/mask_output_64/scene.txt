Late in the year, the day is cold, and guests arrive at the thatched cottage
 In my family, there's always been something good, and only the wine remains a private affair
 With the wine gone, the rooster crows early, and the river is empty of late-arriving geese
 Tomorrow, I'll say goodbye and go back, lighting a candle at night to write a poem
