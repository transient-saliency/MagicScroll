Gaze far into the distance with a vast expanse, playing in the center of the lake
 Green mountains bear white waves, rising and falling above and below
 Lower your head to admire the clouds and the rosy mist, scattered and jumbled as the orchid paddle moves
 Vividly like the Han Gao maiden, and the descending geese suspend in the faint mists
