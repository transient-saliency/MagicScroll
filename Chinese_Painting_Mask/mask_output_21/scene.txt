Hanging it there is a lying wave,carrying a sash is a fish, maybe a rainbow
 Singing and admiring the lake and mountain, it's a habit,dignity, blue, and purple are like craftsmanship
 Light shines on the patterns of the plain moon,the power is biased, and the floating path does not obstruct the wind
 Originally left behind by the printing worker,but now it belongs to old man SuGong again
