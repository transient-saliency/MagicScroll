In a mountain dwelling, I only love tranquility,At noon, I hide behind the firewood gate
 Few gather because many shun, seeking the way within, I honor myself
Swallows and phoenixes both have their aspirations, orchids and mugworts do not share the same root
 How can I, a humble elder, meet you, when we meet, we discuss in detail
