Climbing the Xianglu Peak in the west, I see waterfalls in the south, they hang down for three hundred zhang, and spurts out for several tens of li
 It sounds like a flash of lightning, as it rises like a white rainbow, I'm initially startled by the heavenly river's descent, as it partially sprinkles in the sky
 Looking up at its momentum turning powerful, how magnificent is the work of nature, the sea breeze blows without ceasing, and the river moonlight illuminates the emptiness
 In the air, there's a chaotic spray, washing the green cliffs on the left and right, flying pearls scatter the light mist, and the foamy geyser bubbles against the rocks
