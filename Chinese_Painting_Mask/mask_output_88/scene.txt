Layered peaks and stacked ravines, clouds are thick among the dense woods
 Startling springs fly beyond the ridges, monkeys and cranes silently unmatched
 In the midst, a secluded person dwells, close to the creek and facing the flowing water
 The great river and the sky are one line, with merchant boats coming and going
