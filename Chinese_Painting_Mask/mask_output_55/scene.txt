In this place, the royal carriage once toured,Neighbors vied to see the emperor's figure
 With the world changing, the well still exists, Inscriptions and songs are no longer genuine
 Sword in hand, at the time, I sought escape,Unexpectedly, I entered the pass and surrendered to Qin
 For a thousand years, the desolate platform remains,At sunset, cows and sheep feel the passersby
