I bitterly recall the Cloudy Forest, a romance that can't be retrieved
 Often, I hold a pen, trees and streams are scattered in different corners
 My old eyes have already dimmed, and the romance is no longer the same as in my youth, Reading has become blurred, and how can I have the mood to admire the apricot blossoms
