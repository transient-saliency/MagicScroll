In the depths of the serene lake's mountain scenery, the green pines curl and hide
 Boat shadows gradually move on the surface of the water, blue peaks rise and fall along with pavilions
 Ancient simplicity and elegant grace are seen in the painting, orderly and exquisite in between
 The joy of the secluded residence and its scenery, the mountains and waters, two gems, can't be captured in a painting
