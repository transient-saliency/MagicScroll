Azure pine trees, emerald walls, and the peculiar sound of the waterfall, in June I come to escape the heat and not know it
 The real whereabouts of the immortal can't be found, as I have been standing on White Dragon Pool for a long time
 The White Dragon Pool mimics the pine, snow, and brushwork, while the plum blossoms on Mt
 Qu are clear and side by side
