Swallows fly low, undisturbed by dust
 Yellow orioles are delicate, spring cannot be stopped
 The east wind turns the grass in front of the door green
 Fine rain carries mist, troubling travelers on the road
 The lamp is lit after passing, thoughts of home arise
 Silence reigns, the magpies count the night
 Swallows haven't returned, the plum blossoms have fallen, and the small window's bright moon belongs to the pear blossoms
