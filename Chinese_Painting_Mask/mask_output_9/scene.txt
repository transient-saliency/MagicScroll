Pure and tranquil, leaning on the rail, watching the azure waters
 The mountain is silent, and the fragrance of flowers enters the painting
 Admire the world from the Lizhu Pavilion, listen to the sound of the wind in front of the diligent government hall
 On the Cuiwei Pavilion by the water, welcome the morning sun, and on the Qiyue Cliff, send off the evening clearness
 On the Yuhua peak, the clouds and mist are fine, and in the dense green valleys, the tree shadows move
