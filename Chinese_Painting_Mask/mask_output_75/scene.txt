In the autumn, there is much illness from heat, The soldiers complain about the road
 The swaying pines in the secluded valley cast cool shadows over the courtyard
 Cold springs flow over cliff rocks, white clouds gather in the morning and evening
 I cherish the golden jade, like the beauty of Zhou's son, boundless
