Azure patterns flow in the mountain stream, Ninefold Huai River letters are hard to forge
 The jade mat, with the first breeze, whitens the hair
 Grinding ink, a single inch fears the spring chill
 The sound trickles and rises with the clouds
 Rosy light suddenly rises and the crab is at ease
 This mountain, this water, longs for rain
 It's lovely to see the rivers and mountains reach the Ninth Heaven
