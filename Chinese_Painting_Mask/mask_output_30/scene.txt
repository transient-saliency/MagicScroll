In the snow courtyard, pine shadows remain
 The grass poems and ink marks blend
 Several trees of spring's remaining green, one lamp's door closed in red
 How many times have fish and geese separated
 Returning to the assignment is late, and regret runs deep
 The foolish butterfly still doubts it's a dream, and the hungry bird guards the woods alone
