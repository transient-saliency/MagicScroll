In Wu Gate, two or three calls of traveling geese
 I head to the western river, and you go north on your expedition
 A single piece of moon on a cold night above the building, peach blossoms and flowing water separate the year's emotions
 Two years of yearning, separated by north and south, the lonely boat on the Huai River suddenly meets you
 The night of parting sorrow, our conversation continues through the night
 The west wind on the lakeshore joins the clouds
